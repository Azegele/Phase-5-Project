                    ">The tremendous growth and usage of information has led to information overloading where users find it difficult to locate the right information at a specified time. Although there are previous studies conducted on library recommender systems, the datasets used were small compared to the dataset we intend to use hence minimal area coverage. Recommending the right library books is a challenge due to the variety of genres available and the huge collection of books provided. A user finds it difficult to select the most appropriate book that will suit their academic needs, this process consumes a lot of time that the user would have used to sharpen on their desired skills. Additionally, many books in the library are rarely utilized which results in a waste of library resources. Having a personalized recommendation system seeks to predict the preference based on the user’s interest, behavior and information. The application of recommender systems in a library set up solves the problem of difficulty in choosing books and improves utilization rate of library resources. "

Invited to dinner by the boorish local landowner, Martin Clay, an easily distracted philosopher, and his art-historian wife are asked to assess three dusty paintings blocking the draught from the chimney. But hiding beneath the soot is nothing less-Martin believes-than a lost work by Bruegel. So begins a hilarious trail of lies and concealments, desperate schemes and soaring hopes as Martin, betting all that he owns and much that he doesn't, embarks on a quest to prove his hunch, win his wife over, and separate the painting from its owner. In Headlong, Michael Frayn, \"the master of what is seriously funny\" (Anthony Burgess), offers a procession of superbly realized characters, from the country squire gone to seed to his giddy, oversexed young wife. All are burdened by human muddle and human cravings; all are searching for a moral compass as they grapple with greed, folly, and desire. And at the heart of the clamor is Breugel's vision, its dark tones warning of the real risks of temptation and obsession. With this new novel, Michael Frayn has given us entertainment of the highest order. Supremely wise and wickedly funny, Headlong elevates Frayn into the front rank of contemporary novelists.</td>\n",

In der Handlung um den Hofmeister LÃ¤uffer, der sich in die abhÃ¤ngige Stellung eines Hauslehrers begibt, sich in die Tochter seines Hausherrn verliebt, sie entehrt, flieht, Gehilfen eines Dorfschulmeisters wird und sein neues Ideal eines einfachen, enthaltsamen Lebens bis zur Selbstentmannung verwirklicht, sind tragische mit komischen Elementen aufs Engste miteinander verwoben. Mit dieser Mischung aus Tragischem und Komischem ist quot, Der Hofmeisterquot, eine der frÃ¼hesten TragikomÃ¶dien der deutschen Literaturgeschichte. Lenz verzichtet in seinem quot, offenen Dramaquot, auf die aristotelische Einheit von Ort, Zeit und Handlung und arbeitet mit modernen dramatischen Techniken, etwa vielen kurzen Szenen. Text aus Reclams Universal-Bibliothek mit SeitenzÃ¤hlung der gedruckten Ausgabe.</td>\n",

Con l'amico d'infanzia compie un viaggio di sei giorni durante il quale la donna ritrova se stessa attraverso una riflessione mistico-iniziatica. I due si recano a Lourdes dove cementeranno il loro amore alla luce di una fede che esalta i valori della missione nel mondo.   \n",

                                   "270168  An unlikely con man wagers wife, wealth, and sanity in pursuit of an elusive Old Master. Invited to dinner by the boorish local landowner, Martin Clay, an easily distracted philosopher, and his art-historian wife are asked to assess three dusty paintings blocking the draught from the chimney. But hiding beneath the soot is nothing less-Martin believes-than a lost work by Bruegel. So begins a hilarious trail of lies and concealments, desperate schemes and soaring hopes as Martin, betting all that he owns and much that he doesn't, embarks on a quest to prove his hunch, win his wife over, and separate the painting from its owner. In Headlong, Michael Frayn, \"the master of what is seriously funny\" (Anthony Burgess), offers a procession of superbly realized characters, from the country squire gone to seed to his giddy, oversexed young wife. All are burdened by human muddle and human cravings; all are searching for a moral compass as they grapple with greed, folly, and desire. And at the heart of the clamor is Breugel's vision, its dark tones warning of the real risks of temptation and obsession. With this new novel, Michael Frayn has given us entertainment of the highest order. Supremely wise and wickedly funny, Headlong elevates Frayn into the front rank of contemporary novelists.   \n",

So when she meets a caring, good-looking man who adores her, she casts aside any niggling doubts and accepts his proposal. In a bid to be modern and grown-up, the bride and groom invite a potentially explosive mix of ex-boyfriends and girlfriends, and Fay is determined to enjoy her special day. But there's one person present who has other ideas . . . Jane MooreÂ¿s antennae are perfectly tuned to what men and women really think of each other in the noughties. THE EX FILES is a bracing, witty look at contemporary relationships that will make you laugh and, possibly, make you think as well.   \n",

In der Handlung um den Hofmeister LÃ¤uffer, der sich in die abhÃ¤ngige Stellung eines Hauslehrers begibt, sich in die Tochter seines Hausherrn verliebt, sie entehrt, flieht, Gehilfen eines Dorfschulmeisters wird und sein neues Ideal eines einfachen, enthaltsamen Lebens bis zur Selbstentmannung verwirklicht, sind tragische mit komischen Elementen aufs Engste miteinander verwoben. Mit dieser Mischung aus Tragischem und Komischem ist quot, Der Hofmeisterquot, eine der frÃ¼hesten TragikomÃ¶dien der deutschen Literaturgeschichte. Lenz verzichtet in seinem quot, offenen Dramaquot, auf die aristotelische Einheit von Ort, Zeit und Handlung und arbeitet mit modernen dramatischen Techniken, etwa vielen kurzen Szenen.

[It is] irresistible and as nearly flawless as any fiction could be.\" This volume is the companion to the BBC television series, a lavish production aired on the Arts and Entertainment Network.   \n",

[It is] irresistible and as nearly flawless as any fiction could be.\" This volume is the companion to the BBC television series, a lavish production aired on the Arts and Entertainment Network.   \n",
